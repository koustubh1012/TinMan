## Acme Robotics (Tinman) A Mobile Autonomous Robot for Collection of Waste in Cafeteria

## Overview

TinMan is an innovative autonomous robot designed to revolutionize waste management in cafeteria settings by collecting discarded aluminum cans. Developed by ACME Robotics, TinMan is an efficient, hygienic, and sustainable solution that reduces labor costs, promotes recycling, and addresses the challenges of dynamic and cluttered environments.

## Purpose

Cafeterias generate significant amounts of recyclable waste, particularly aluminum cans. Manual collection is inefficient, time-consuming, and unhygienic. TinMan autonomously navigates the cafeteria, identifies and collects scattered cans, and disposes of them at a designated area once its onboard collection bin is full.

## Developer Documentation

### Dependencies

1. ROS2 Humble: ROS2 Humble installed on a system with Ubuntu 22.04. Follow the instructions on this [website](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) to install ROS2 Humble.

2. OpenCV: Follow the instructions on this [website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-opencv-in-c-on-linux/) to install OpenCV. This is required to detect the cans using classical image processing algorithms

3. [Gazebo](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu) : Gazebo latest version was installed for deploying simulation environments and running the models in the project package. [website]

### Building the code
Before running any of the following, ensure that you are in the main working directory (Root Folder of the directory). To build the project, execute the following commands

```bash
    # Create a working directory:
    mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
    # got ho src directory
    cd ~/ros_ws/src
    # Clone the git repository in the src directory
    git clone https://github.com/koustubh1012/TinMan
    # now go back to ros_ws directory and download all the dependencies
    cd .. 
    rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y
    # build the package
    colcon build --packages-select tinman
    # source underlay and overlay
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.sh
    source install/setup.bash
```

### Running the Program Executable 

To recreate the demo, use the following command:

```bash
    #work in progress
```

### To run the tests 
Test Driven Development process was followed and the unit tests can be run by the following command:

```bash
    cd ~/ros_ws
    colcon test --packages-select tinman

```

## Clang-Formating
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
#Clang-format 
clang-format -i --style=Google $(find . -name *.cpp -o -name *.hpp | grep -v "/build/")

```
## Cpp-Lint
```bash
# go to your ros2 workspace directory
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
#Cpp Lint
cpplint --filter=-legal/copyright,-build/c++11,+build/c++17,-build/namespaces,-build/include_order $(find . -name *.cpp | grep -v "/build/")

```
## Clang-tidy
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
# Build the workspace again with the camake args to generate compile_commands.jason file for Clang-tidy to work
colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
#Clang-tidy command
clang-tidy -p build/tinman --extra-arg=-std=c++17 src/TinMan/src/*.cpp -header-filter=.*
```

## Known Issues / bugs
There was an issue before of not executing the level 2 integration test. This was mainly due to the name conflict of package and executable. They should not be same.
